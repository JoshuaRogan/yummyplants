		<p> Our vegan-friendly restaurant section lists restaurants where you can get a vegan entree.  We only list restaurants that we have visited or our community members have submitted, where we can promise that can eat more than just a salad.  Please keep checking back: the Yummy Plants team and our community members are adding new vegan-friendly restaurants all the time.  If you donâ€™t see your favorite vegan-friendly restaurant listed, please use this link to share your favorites with the community!  http://yummyplants.com/submit-a-restaurant/ </p>

		<p> <em> Note: All of the restaurants that we list are vegan-friendly.  Some are 100% vegan restaurants and are listed as 100% vegan in the description.  Most of the restaurants in our list serve vegan and non-vegan food options. </em> </p>
