			"A Greedy Algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. This time we do it with Threads. Write one greedy algorithm that when it is activated colors the node assigned to it as follows: First it check to see if the node has never been colored (color = 0), if so, it check the colors of its neighbors and colors the node with an available (not used by any neighbor) color. After deciding on a color, it checks it neighbors and if a neighbor is uncolors, it notifies the neighbor, or if the neighbor is the same color as the one chosen then it notifies the neighbor to recolor itself.
